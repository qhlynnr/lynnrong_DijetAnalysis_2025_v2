Selections based off of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01651
EmissT > 200 GeV
pt1 > 100 GeV

1. Why Emiss over A_J or vice versa?
2. In the paper the selection is only on leading jet eta (which is what I did here), but why don't they select for all etas?
3. Article did not elaborate on minimum jet2 energy, Hence used pt2 > 50GeV
4. Can we just select high energy

With 
EMiss > 200GeV
pt1 > 100GeV
pt2 > 50GeV
dPhi > 7/8 theta
A_J > 0.5 (not included in the paper)
centrality < 20
|leading jeta| < 2
Total number of events: 289

Choosing Events with A_J > 0.8: Total number of events: 69
Choosing events with EMiss > 300: Total number of events: 130

Choosing EMiss > 350 and A_J > 0.8: Total number of events: 24
